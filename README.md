## Realm


## Installation

* Repository : [https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa)
* Detail Document: [https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest)

### CocoaPods

1. Install CocoaPods
2. Run `pod repo update`
3. `pod init`
3. In you Podfile, add `use_frameworks!` and `pod 'RealmSwift` to your main and test targets.
4. From the command line run `pod install`
5. Use the `.xcworkspace` file generated by CocoaPods to work on your project!

### Cathage

1. Install Carthage 0.33.0 or later
2. Add `github "realm/realm-cocoa"` to your Cartfile.
3. Run `carthage update`.
4. Drag `RealmSwift.framework` and `Realm.framwork` from the appropriate platform directory in `Carthage/Build/` to the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" section of your Xcode project's "General" settings.

iOS/tvOS/watchOS: On your application target’s “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script with the following contents:

```
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```
and add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under “Input Files”, e.g.:

```
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Realm.framework$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/RealmSwift.framework
```
This script works around an App Store submission bug triggered by universal binaries.
